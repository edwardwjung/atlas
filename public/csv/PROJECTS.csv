1,brain-tumor,research,ongoing,Gliomas are the most common type of primary brain tumor in adults. Imaging assessment of brain tumors is most typically performed using MR (magnetic resonance) imaging.,brain MRI cancer,https://www.mdpi.com/applsci/applsci-10-01999/article_deploy/html/images/applsci-10-01999-g001.png,https://github.com/caidm-research/projects/blob/master/docs/brain-tumor/README.md,,https://uc-health-ai.slack.com/archives/C015ADF2C5V
2,dementia,research,ongoing,Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning  to such an extent that it interferes with a person's daily life and activities. It is most commonly classified using PET Scans which measure beta amyloid. This project discusses the role of Supervised Contrastive learning in dementia detection.,brain PET,https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/jnumed/51/6/913/F1.large.jpg,,https://github.com/Cyb3rBlaze/CAIDM-dementia,https://uc-health-ai.slack.com/archives/C021J8QLS87
4,kidney,research,abandoned,Renal tumors are abnormal growths that occur within the kidneys. Some renal tumors are benign (not cancerous) while others are malignant (cancerous). Imaging assessment of renal tumors is performed both to characterize the lesion itself and to plan surgical approach.,kidney MRI cancer,https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-017-01779-0/MediaObjects/41598_2017_1779_Fig2_HTML.jpg,https://github.com/caidm-research/projects/blob/master/docs/kidney/README.md,,https://uc-health-ai.slack.com/archives/C016HTU9UEM
3,breast-density,research,complete, Breast cancer is the most common non-skin cancer in women. A key biomarker for risk of cancer development is breast density (e.g. amount of fibroglandular tissue in the breast). In this project we will characterize breast density in a large population using deep learning algorithms applied to both mammograms and breast MRIs.,label1 label2 label3,https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/jnumed/51/6/913/F1.large.jpg,https://github.com/caidm-research/projects/blob/master/docs/breast-density/README.md,,https://uc-health-ai.slack.com/archives/C015YH6V24E
